# CTImage-processing

Operating System: Windows XP
Integrated Development Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
Compile environment: NET Framework

In designing this system, we mainly designed five functions: file operations; image display; image processing; multiple views and view layouts; measurement markers. Each function is divided into various sub-functions of the same kind. File operations: Open, save, save all, and set the path. Image display: 2D (image plane display), MPR image reconstruction (MPR reconstruction technique of multi-slice spiral CT), and Volume image reconstruction (3D volume reconstruction based on CT slice feature matching). Image processing: adjust the window, zoom, move, rotate, zoom in and cut. Multi-view and view layout: 1*1 layout, 2*2 layout, 3*3 layout, 4*4 layout, and you can also set the number of rows and columns to attempt layout. Image measurement: straight lines, rectangles, ellipses, text, and adjustment graphics. At the same time, we can select a single image for specific processing.
